# Recycle Radar 

## Inspiration

Recycling shouldn't be a mystery or a hassle for anyone. We wanted to make a tool to help with all things recycling - whether it's identifying how to recycle something, or locating a local depot.

## What it does

Our features include:
- ### Interactive Map
    - Show nearby recycling depots / providers, differentiated by colors and labels
    - Includes details about accepted recycling types
    - Get directions
- ### Recycling Assistant
    - Uses machine learning to recognize object from image
    - Returns helpful information about recycling the object
    - Input object by text if image processing fails
    - Extra table for sorting plastics 
- ### News / Events Feed
    - Updated daily
    - Relevant articles
    - Community events
- ### (COMING SOON) Community Discussion Board
    - Planning events like bottle drives, street cleanups
    - General questions about recycling, local guidelines

## How we built it

The website was built using **ReactJS**, using VSCode with the Live Share extension for collaboration. We also used Figma for our mobile app mock-up

## Challenges we ran into

As beginners, working on a project as a team under a time crunch is something we didn't have much experience with. Still, the more we worked together the more we got used to collaborating and sharing ideas. By speaking up when we had issues, we were able to come up with solutions as a team.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Having a cohesive final product
- Proud of how we worked as a team
- Exploring how to use tools that were new to some of us
- Meaningful idea that tackles a real problem

## What we learned
